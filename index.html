    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3> Outsourced Encrypted Medical Images, A Quick Nearest Neighbour Search Scheme, (Java)</h3>
      <p>Developed a secure and efficient cloud-based system using Java to retrieve nearest neighbor medical images
 from encrypted data. This project addressed the challenge of balancing data security with efficient retrieval in
 remote server environments. The implemented algorithm [mention specific algorithm used, e.g., Locality
 Sensitive Hashing] achieved a [quantify improvement, e.g., 15%] improvement in retrieval speed compared to
 traditional methods while maintaining strong encryption. Future work involves collaborating with a healthcare
 organization to develop and deploy a prototype for real-world application. [Optional: Briefly mention any
 specific libraries or technologies used, e.g., cryptographic libraries, cloud platforms].</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Fast Fitness(Mobile Application Development) </h3>
      <p> Designed and developed "Fast Fitness," a mobile application using Java aimed at revolutionizing personalized
 fitness tracking. This app addresses the challenge of fragmented fitness data by consolidating workout
 tracking, nutrition logging, and sleep monitoring into a single, user-friendly platform. Key features include [list
 2-3 key features, e.g., personalized workout plans, calorie tracking, progress visualization]. [Optional: If you
 have any metrics from user testing or beta release, include them here. For example: "Beta testing showed a
 20% increase in user engagement compared to similar fitness apps"]. [Optional: Mention any specific
 technologies used, e.g., Android SDK, specific database].</p>
